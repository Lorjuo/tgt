TGT CMS
=============

This is kind of a CMS that is specially designed for sport clubs or similar associations.
Originally it was intended to suit only the needs for my own sports club to replace our [old homepage](http://www.tgtraisa.de).
In the meantime it has developed to a more and more complex content management system and it is very generic.


Features
--------
* I18N (actually english and german)
* Multi department support
* Hierarchy organized pages (possibility to use rails controllers inside hierarchy)
* Multi-theme support - create your own theme for departments and subpages
* Administration integrated into frontend
* Authorization system depending on departments
* Manage your trainers, groups, galleries, documents and events


Usage
-----
Admin interface is on `yoursite.tld/auth/sign_in`
Username: `admin@tgtraisa.de`
Password: `admin`

Screenshots
